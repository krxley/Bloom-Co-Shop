# Bloom-Co-Shop

Welcome! Bloom-Co-Shop is a modern, responsive online store built with a focus on clean design, accessibility, and smooth shopping experiences.  
I created this project to deepen my front-end skills and explore practical e-commerce UI patterns—balancing professional standards with my own creative interests.

## About the Project

Bloom-Co-Shop features a minimalist interface, intuitive navigation, and product layouts that adapt gracefully to any device.  
Key highlights:
- Semantic HTML & SCSS for maintainable, scalable code
- Smooth cart interactions and dynamic product browsing
- Accessibility-first choices for color, contrast, and keyboard flow
- Fast load times and simple, friendly UX

## Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself to build an e-commerce app from scratch—not just as a technical demo, but as a learning journey.  
Throughout development, I kept notes on what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently next time.

## Demo

- Live site: [Bloom-Co-Shop](https://krxley.github.io/Bloom-Co-Shop/)

## Technologies

- HTML5
- SCSS
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Optional: JSON for product data

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required—static and fast)
3. To customize products, edit the data JSON or HTML as needed

## What’s Next

- Add checkout/payment integrations
- Expand product catalog and filtering
- Polish accessibility for even wider audiences
